#  Pulsegen notes

- leds for pulsedone signal

- pulse restart logic? repeat?

- registers big endian... meh

- switching settings from continous to pulsedone

- duc reuse?

- currently fft computation output to interpolators for debug

- better fft mem individual adress write and clear all function?


#  Artiq questions
